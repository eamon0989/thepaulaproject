<p id="notdonep">Remember that his brain is broken and he may have forgotten, write down here what he should have done and he'll try to do better next time.</p>
<p id="angryp">First he wants you to know that he is very sorry. His brain is broken and he doesn't know how to control it, but he knows that is no excuse. Look at this cute picture of you together and remember all the good times!<img id="cute" src="cute.jpg"></p>
<p id="ignorep">He's probably overwhelmed and has been doing too much, when this happens he tends to shut down. Tell him that you need to spend some time with him and he will.</p>
<p id="noreasonp">His dumbass brain doesn't work very well and sometimes he hyper-focuses on stupid things. Click here to remind him that you need some time with him.</p>
